# React + Vite

This project is a Todo List application built using React and the Context API. It was created while learning from the Chai aur Code YouTube channel. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks efficiently.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
